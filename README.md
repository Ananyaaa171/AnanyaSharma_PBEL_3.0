## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

The following models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier ⭐ (Best Performing)
- XGBoost Classifier

The Random Forest model is used for deployment because it achieved the best performance on the dataset.

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset** containing anonymized European card transactions.

Dataset characteristics:

- 31 Features
- Highly Imbalanced Dataset
- Binary Classification
- Fraud Label:
  - **0 → Legitimate**
  - **1 → Fraud**

## 📷 Application Workflow

1. Upload CSV dataset.
2. Backend preprocesses transaction data.
3. Random Forest model predicts each transaction.
4. Results are displayed instantly.
5. Pie Chart and Bar Chart visualize fraud distribution.
6. User can search predictions.
7. Prediction report can be downloaded as CSV.
